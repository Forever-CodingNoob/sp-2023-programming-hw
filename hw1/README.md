## SP2023_HW1_release
#### Reminders
You should not modify content under .github. If caught, you will receive a 0 for this assignment.

If you use some advanced features like branch, make sure your code is merged into main branch (the default branch). TA will use the last commit before deadline in main branch for judging.

#### Sample Judge
###### Usage
```
python3 samplejudge.py
```
###### Argument

- `-t TASK [TASK ...]`, `--task TASK [TASK ...]`, Specify which tasks you want to run. If you didn't set this argument, `samplejudge.py` will run all tasks by default.
    - Valid TASK are ["0_1", "0_2", "1_1", "1_2"].
    - for example `python3 samplejudge.py --task 0_1 0_2` will run both `testcase0_1` and `testcase0_2`

###### Notice

Score printed by `samplejudge.py` is just for your reference. Real judge is much more complicated than `samplejudge.py`.

Thus, you should still test some complex cases by yourselves, maybe by ./server, ./client. Of course, if you can understand `samplejudge.py`, feel free to modify it or add your own testcases.
